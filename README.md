Mii Channel Music Box - CS 351
We were assigned to write code for a music box that would play notes to make a song or tune of our choosing. I chose the Mii Channel Music and was able to split up the audio and correlate certain notes in the theme song to play with the listing of certain letters. The layout gets weird if the window is minimized so go full screen.
